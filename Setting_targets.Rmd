Paper will have league tables by region - region as facets on the Y-axis (vertical), and cost/DALY on the X-axis (horizontal) with a dashed line for each facet denoting the regional WTP

Shiny app has the league tables by country (too much to fit into one)

For the main analysis - we have historic prevalence, projected rates in 2030 (by region)

2030 rate of anaemia: 
- option 1 is just a spline extrapolation from last knot (based on current trends)
- option 2 is to take the last date we have coverage data for, then get the rate of anaemia at that time and multiply it by the predicted population in 2030
